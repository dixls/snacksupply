For a while now, I've been feeling like I should make a little e-cargo bike. I'd
looked at examples like the [Specialized Globe Haul ST]() which is very close to
being what I want, and a lot of custom projects like this one from [LaMarche]()
(based in Philly!), or this one from [Destroy Bikes](). This format of bike is 
really appealing to me because it is more or less the same length as a standard
bicycle, while fitting a good amount of cargo carrying capacity. The smaller
wheels are less efficient for pedaling, but with e-assist, that's mostly taken
care of.
