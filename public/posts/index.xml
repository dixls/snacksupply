      <description>Draft of a mini cargo bike geometry For a while now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling like I should make a little e-cargo bike. I&amp;rsquo;d looked at examples like the Specialized Globe Haul ST which is very close to being what I want, and a lot of custom projects like this one from LaMarche (based in Philly!), or this one from Destroy Bikes. This format of bike is really appealing to me because it is more or less the same length as a standard bicycle, while fitting a good amount of cargo carrying capacity.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I should finally make a little website just for random thoughts and links. I haven&amp;rsquo;t put a ton of thought into what this all will look like, but i&amp;rsquo;m working on it, hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll actually keep up with this thing.&#xA;For now, this site is made with Hugo, because I&amp;rsquo;ve used it before, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to make something simple and nice, and in theory it&amp;rsquo;ll be easy to jump into it and update it.</description>
